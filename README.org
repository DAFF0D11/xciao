* Xciao
X ClassName In And Out

Transform one key press in to another for specific X windows only.

Some applications have horrible keybindings and no way to configure them. \\
Our only hope is to make the good keybindings produce the bad keybindings.


** Setup

*** Create remaps

Remaps are defined in xciao.c

You need to supply the class name of the window, the key you want to press
(Inputs) and the keys you want to produce for that class name (Outputs).

If you are familiar with dwm, you will recognize the key naming conventions.
- ControlMask -> Control
- Mod1Mask    -> Alt
- Mod4Mask    -> Super/Hyper/Windows

#+begin_src c
   /* xciao.c */

   static Remap remaps[] = {
  /*   Class  | Input mask  | Input key | Output mask | Output key */
    {"Chromium", "ControlMask", "j",           "ControlMask", "Prior"},/* Control-j -> Previous tab */
    {"Chromium", "ControlMask", "k",           "ControlMask", "Next"}, /* Control-k -> Next tab */
    {"Chromium", "ControlMask", "h",           "Mod1Mask",    "Home"}, /* Control-h -> Home page */
    {"Chromium", "ControlMask", "d",           "",            "Next"}, /* Control-d -> Page down */
    {"Chromium", "ControlMask", "u",           "",            "Prior"},/* Control-u -> Page up */
    {"Chromium", "ControlMask", "bracketleft", "Mod1Mask",    "Left"}, /* Control-[ -> Backwards history */
    {"Chromium", "ControlMask", "bracketright","Mod1Mask",    "Right"},/* Control-] -> Forwards history */
    {"Chromium", "Mod1Mask",    "h",           "",            "Left"}, /* Alt-h -> Left arrow key */
    {"Chromium", "Mod1Mask",    "j",           "",            "Down"}, /* Alt-j -> Down arrow key */
    {"Chromium", "Mod1Mask",    "k",           "",            "Up"},   /* Alt-k -> Up arrow key */
    {"Chromium", "Mod1Mask",    "l",           "",            "Right"},/* Alt-l -> Right arrow key */
   };
#+end_src

*** Compile

You will need xlib header files. \\
In the xciao directory compile with:
#+begin_src sh
  gcc -o xciao xciao.c -lX11
#+end_src

*** Install

Manually install the executable to some place in your path.
#+begin_src sh
  cp xciao some/place/in/path
#+end_src

*** Sxhkd mappings

Simply pass xciao the key you're using to trigger the command.
#+begin_src sh
  # sxhkd

  # Previous tab
  control + j
      xciao "ControlMask" "j"

  # Next tab
  control + k
      xciao "ControlMask" "k"

  # Forward history
  control + bracketleft
      xciao "ControlMask" "bracketleft"

  # Backwards history
  control + bracketright
      xciao "ControlMask" "bracketright"

  ...
 #+end_src

 Start sxhkd
 #+begin_src sh
   sxhkd -c path/to/xciao/sxhkd
 #+end_src

** What about...

*** Xdotool

In the context of using xdotool with sxhkd, xdotool very often requires a vast
array of hacks/workarounds to work. sleep 0.2, --delay, --clearmodifiers,
spamming the keys, @release. These workarounds can even be application and
monitor dependent.

*** Extensions

In regards to browsers, extensions have a number of limitations that native
keybindings do not.

1. Loading pages block extensions.
2. Extensions are unavailable on some pages.
   - Downloads
   - History
   - Extensions (ironically)
