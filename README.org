* XCIAO (WIP)

X Classname In And Out

Turn one keypress in to another for specific X window

** Say ciao to terrible default keybinds
Native keybinds in programs like Chrome and Firefox are TERRIBLE.

Do people actually use keybinds like:

#+begin_src shell
Control + Tab, Control + Shift + Tab
#+end_src

My hands feel cramped just reading that

** How?
Use a tool like SXHKD with XCIAO

*** Brave-browser

Extensions like vimium and surfingkeys are execellent tools for re-mapping keys
to more comfortable alternatives.

However, extensions have limitations.

1. Some pages do not have access to extensions such as:
   History, Bookmarks and Downloads pages.
2. Pages must load extensions, if a pages is having trouble loading, you must
   wait for it.

By re-mapping native keybinds overcomes these limitations.

control + j # Previous tab
